# Reda

The way to own your library.

Website: [usereda.app](https://www.usereda.app)

# Major "could have been different/better"s
- Realm or WatermelonDB (technically still SQLite) instead of SQLite
- Zustand + MMKV instead of context
- Better folder structure
- Proper types for navigation

# Status
While I **may** continue to merge PRs and add features from time to time, I cannot assure you of any frequent updates. Feel free to fork this repository to add features you'd like to see in the app.
You'll find the article all about this [here](https://trulyao.dev/blog/what-about-reda).
